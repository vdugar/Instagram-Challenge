# An attempt to solve the Instagram Challenge, described at -
# http://instagram-engineering.tumblr.com/post/12651721845/instagram-engineering-challenge-the-unshredder

# Given an image that has been shredded into 'n' equal-width jumbled  columns, this script attempts to put the image back together (or 'unshred' it).

# Usage:

python shredder.py source_image NO_OF_SHREDS
# Use this to shred the image

python instagram.py [shredded_image] [NO_OF_SHREDS] [shred_method]
# The unshredder. Outputs to 'unshredded.jpg'
# shred_method can be either one of the following-
# edge : Uses edge detection
# euc : Uses Euclidean distances over average pixels

# Note-> Both the shredder and unshredder work properly only if (IMAGE_WIDTH / NO_OF_SHREDS) is a whole number.
